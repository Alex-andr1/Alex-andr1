## Hi there, I'm Aleksandr 👋
### The young and ambitious web developer 😁

- 🔭 I’m currently working on online store, fullstack project.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **React**, best JavaScript framework for web applications (in my opinion).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on potential customers.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with employment in a promising company.
- 💬 Ask me about how to align any div to the center of the ✨universe✨.
- ⚡ Fun fact: JavaScript doesn't have his personal mascot. How do you like this cute guy? 🦏
